# Google Consent Denier
Finally you can just click "deny everything" on Googles Consent Page. :-)

The Plugin will, if you allow it (the plugin asks when it detects the consent dialogue), click on the "Adjust" button and click on "Deny" at each possibility.
Then it leads you back to the regular Google Search.

Debug the Code with web-ext, or just install the xpi in the release folder or under Releases ;-)

Take a look at the LICENSE File, before cloning or downloading of the Release File, thank you.
